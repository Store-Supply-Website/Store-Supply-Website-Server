## Introduction <br/>
Store Supply Website
We are creating a Business-to-Business platform to assist companies selecting the right supplies to purchase. We help buyers and sellers find each other and co-operate efficiently. Customers will find great deals on new products and contact sellers directly. Our customers are small to mid-sized companies or individual buyers. Sellers can display and advertise their products on the platform, and leave their contact information. Some good examples of supplies include home improvement supplies, pet store supplies or restaurant supplies.
